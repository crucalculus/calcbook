calcbook
========

My own project of developing a Calculus textbook for high school students.

The book should be written in LaTex using a page design inspired by the Tufte-book document class.
My initial thought is that all pages are in landscape page orientation to facilitate graphs, figures, etc.

There should also be a workbook-type feel, as there should be some space left for students to complete basic
exercises and activities. Problem sets should be included, but these can be completed in a separate notebook.

Mathematical literacy should also be a theme throughout the book. With emphasis placed on becoming an independent
mathematical thinker.
